We use a 2 dimensional array as a collection of our buffers.
The Producer thread keeps reading data into the buffer until the buffer is full.
The Consumer takes out data from buffer while there is data in the buffer.
At the end of the playback(or when 'x' is inputted), buffer is cleaned to notify the Producer there is no more work to do. Consumer terminates itself without any help.
